Yield Curve Decomposition and Dynamic Trading Strategy

## Overview
This repository focuses on exploring the dynamics of the yield curve and developing a dynamic trading strategy inspired by Johan Hagenbjörk’s work. The strategy concentrates on three primary factors: Level, Slope, and Curvature, simplifying the analysis for accessibility and focus. Through data collection, principal component analysis (PCA), Gaussian Copulas, and predictive modeling techniques, we aim to capitalize on yield curve movements for trading opportunities.

Feedback and contributions are welcome.
